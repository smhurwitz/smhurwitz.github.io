      <p>Hello, and welcome to my personal website! Here you can find information on everything from my <a href="physics.html" target="_blank">physics research</a> and professional activities to <a href="music.html" target="_blank">my music</a> and <a href="projects.html" target="_blank">personal projects</a>. I truly am always delighted to meet new people, so please feel free to <a href="mailto:G7e9b@example.com">shoot me an email</a>, say hi if you spot me somewhere, or leave mysterious and unmarked letters.</p>

      <p>I am currently a fourth-year PhD candidate in physics at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD), where I study the nuclear fusion device called a stellarator (read my explanation of fusion and these wacky guys!) as part of the <a href="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~mattland/" target="_blank"
        >UMD Stellarator Group</a> under <a href="https://ireap.umd.edu/clark/faculty/1279/Matt-Landreman" target="_blank">Matt Landreman</a>. In contrast to every other source of power, fusion devices are considered ideal energy sources since they offer clean, safe, and limitless energy. As we live amidst dual climate and energy crises, for this reason I believe it is essential to rapidly develop viable fusion reactors and distribute them equitably across the world in accordance with a climate justice framework. </p>
        
      <p>Like other members of my group, I use plasma physics theory and high-performance computing to better understand and design stellarators. In my most recent project, for instance, I derived a numerically rapid and highly accurate formula for the magnetic forces on stellarator coils, and used this to design coils with significantly reduced forces for the Landreman-Paul precise QA configuration. </p>

      <p>In order to ultimately operate fusion reactors <i>en masse</i>, it is also essential to design a favourable policy landscape and develop a large and diverse fusion workforce. As I am also highly passionate about science outreach, I take part in a number of extracurriculars in this vein. As part of the <a href="https://www.fusiondelegation.org/meet-the-delegation/2025-delegation" target="_blank">2025 cohort</a> of the <a href="https://www.fusiondelegation.org/home" target="_blank">Fusion Student Delegation (FUSD)</a>, I will advocate for fusion energy to policymakers and members of various federal agencies and groups in Washington, D.C. in June 2025. I also volunteer with the <a href="https://www.cranephysics.org" target="_blank">Computational Research Access NEtwork (CRANE)</a> to give free education in plasma physics to students from marginalized backgrounds.</p>

      <p>As a queer and trans woman, it is a fundamental value of mine to advocate for marginalized people and create safe, inclusive, and bold spaces both within physics and in my ordinary life. As somebody who deeply struggled with identity and health throughout her career, I deeply wish to foster a community within physics and serve as a mentor figure. I especially hope to, provided I remain in academia, form a research group where I can do just that.</p>

      <p>I highly encourage you to reach out to me, especially if you're queer or interested in research</p>
      
      <p>Prior to my time at UMD, I studied physics at Cornell University for four incredible years and ultimately obtained my B.A. in 2020. While there, I also worked as part of the <a href="https://www.classe.cornell.edu/Research/CMS/Phase2/WebHome.html" target="_blank">Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) group</a> on the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) upgrade project to CERN. Before this, I grew up in Florida's Space Coast where I was making music wherever I could. </p>
