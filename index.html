      <p>Hello, and welcome to my personal website! Here you can find information on everything from my physics research and professional activities to my music, extracurriculars, and other various projects. I truly am always delighted to meet new people, so please feel free to <a href="mailto:G7e9b@example.com">shoot me an email</a>, say hi if you spot me somewhere, or leave mysterious and unmarked letters.</p>

      <p>I am currently a fourth-year PhD candidate in physics at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD), where I study the nuclear fusion reactor called a stellarator (read my explanation of these wacky devices here!) as part of the <a href="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~mattland/" target="_blank"
        >UMD Stellarator Group</a> under <a href="https://ireap.umd.edu/clark/faculty/1279/Matt-Landreman" target="_blank"
        >Matt Landreman</a>. Like other members of my group, I use plasma physics theory and high-performance computing to better understand and design stellarators. In my most recent project, for instance, I derived a numerically rapid and highly accurate formula for the magnetic forces on stellarator coils, and used this to design coils with significantly reduced forces for the Landreman-Paul precise QA configuration. </p>

      <p>Prior to my time at UMD, I studied physics at Cornell University for four incredible years and ultimately obtained my B.A. in 2020. While there, I also worked as part of the <a href="https://www.classe.cornell.edu/Research/CMS/Phase2/WebHome.html" target="_blank">Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) group</a> on the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) upgrade project to CERN. Before this, I grew up in Florida's Space Coast where I was making music wherever I could. </p>
